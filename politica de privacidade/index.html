You can find a summary of your rights below in this section.<br><br>


A. The right to access. You have a right to obtain the confirmation as to whether or not your data is being processed by us. In addition, you have a right to obtain more detailed information about the data kept and the processing undertaken by us and under certain circumstances the right to receive a copy of this data.

In addition, you have a right to obtain more detailed information about the data kept and the processing undertaken by us and under certain circumstances the right to receive a copy of this data.
<br><br>

B. The right to rectification. You have the right to have inaccurate data about you rectified, and, taking into account the purpose of the processing, to have incomplete data completed.<br><br>


C. The right to erasure. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. In order to Delete your Account and all of the personal data currently stored in our system you can do so, by logging into your Account go to – Personal Data section and then Account Settings and at the Bottom of the Page you can proceed with your request by selecting- Terminate Account – Delete My Account and all of its data.

E. The right to data portability. To the extent the legal basis for the processing is your consent, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others and/or in case it may be technically impossible to do so.
<br><br>

F. The right to object. Subject to the legal basis on which the processing activity is based, you may object to processing of your personal data. Please note that in some cases, we may have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which we need to comply with. G. The right to withdraw consent. To the extent that the legal basis for the processing is your consent, you have the right to withdraw from that consent at any time. This may apply to marketing purposes and/or with regards to the transfer of your data to third parties. In case you withdraw from a consent given, then we will cease to process your data, unless and to the extent the continued processing is permitted or required according to the applicable data regulation or other applicable laws and regulations. The withdrawal from your consent will in no event affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
<br><br>

H. The right to complain to the data protection supervisory authority. We do our best to ensure that we protect your data, keep you informed about how we process your data and comply with the applicable data protection regulation.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data breach and will notify you of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

<br><br>
Your help is always valuable in ensuring that your data is kept safe. Upon registration to the Website (or its mobile version), the Client will be asked to choose a username and password to be used by the Client on each future login and for the performance of transactions and use of the Company's Services. In order to protect the Client's privacy and operation with the Website sharing registration details (including without limitation, username and password) by the Client with other persons or business entities is strictly prohibited. The Company shall not be held responsible for any damage or loss caused to the Client due to improper use (including prohibited and unprotected use) or storage of such username and password, including any such use made by a third party, and whether or not known to or authorized by the Client.
<br><br>

 Any use of the Website with the Client's username and password is Client's sole responsibility. The Company shall not be held responsible for any such use, including for validation that Client is actually operating in his/her account.
 <br><br>

The Client is obliged to forthwith notify the Company's client service of any suspicion for unauthorized use of the Client’s account. You may contact us at any time through the points of contact listed in the Section OUR CONTACT DETAILS below.
<br><br>

Encryption of your data in transit. Encryption provides a high level of security and privacy for your data. When you enter your data in our platform we use strong encryption technologies (such as Transport Layer Security) to protect your data during transmission from your devices to our servers. For providing more trust and security we use digital EV (Extended Validation) Certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities. You can see the ‘Green Bar’ in the supported browser versions which confirms what all transmitted data is secure. Protection of your data in our infrastructure.
<br><br>

We make it a priority to develop services that are secure "by default". The "default" security of our services means that all new services and features are designed with strict security requirements in mind before we even begin development. This is the key to guaranteed protection and privacy of all data that our services handle and store, once the service or new feature is released. To secure your data, we use the pseudonymisation which allows most of our services to operate without using your actual data. Instead of that, our services use a system ID that can't be traced back to identify you.
<br><br>

The Company is always vigilant about the security of your data stored in our infrastructure. Because of that we locate all our equipment which is used for your data processing in secure data centers. Network access to this equipment is isolated from the Internet. We use network segmentation for isolation of services which need different levels of security from each other. In addition, we restrict logical access to your data for our employees on a "need to know" basis. So, only the personnel that really require access to your data for the purpose of providing you with our best service, will have access to it.

<br><br>
Threats protection. Our Company is highly knowledgeable about modern threats to data security and privacy, and we are well prepared to combat them. All events that occur in our infrastructure are continuously monitored, analyzed and responded to, which allows us to ensure proper protection of your data, keeping it safe from threats, vulnerabilities, and the effects of malware. In the event of a failure that affects the accessibility of your data, we have data backup and recovery procedures in place that will help us restore your data in a short time.
<br><br>

To guarantee quick recovery, we use high availability mode enabled for most critical databases which allows us to minimize downtime. Employee awareness of data security. Our employees may handle your data in order to provide you with first-class service.
<br><br>

To guarantee the security and confidentiality of your data, we monitor all employees’ actions with access to your data in our systems and grant access strictly on a "need to know" basis: only employees who need access will receive it. We hold regular training sessions to make sure that each employee understands the principles that the Company follows to achieve robust data security and privacy.
<br><br>

If you choose not to give your personal information. In the context of our business relationship we may need to collect data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you. Without this data, we are, in principle, not in a position to close or execute a contract with you. If you choose not to give us this data, it may delay or prevent us from meeting our obligations. It may also mean that we cannot perform services needed to run your accounts or policies.
<br><br>

To what extent we carry automated decision-making and profiling. In establishing and carrying out a business relationship, we generally do not use automated decision-making. If we use this procedure in individual cases, we will inform you of this separately. In some cases, we may proceed with profiling in order to evaluate certain personal aspects. We shall inform you accordingly in case we perform any profiling. In general, any data collection that is optional would be made clear at the point of collection.
